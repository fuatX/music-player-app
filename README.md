Button descriptions:

Random Selection:
By selecting this option, after a song concludes, the system will pick a song at random for playback. Please note that occasionally the same song might be chosen due to the random nature of the selection process.

Loop Playback:
When the "Spin" button is engaged, the system will consistently replay the currently selected song in a loop.

Combined Functionality:
In cases where both the "Random Selection" and "Loop Playback" options are simultaneously active, the system will continuously replay the same song in a loop.
